# FES

**FES machine simulator**

I made This simple code for my internship at Driven NeuroRecovery Center as my intern project. I noticed that when we started the internship, we had to use the actual machine to get used to it, which took longer since we wouldn't be able to use it all the time. This simulator can help future interns get used to it better and learn some valuable keywords that will be useful during their time there! This is not by any chance original from the creators of the FES machine and has some differences to fit an online platform. Mostly the same! 

Don't worry about the "help" button ;)
